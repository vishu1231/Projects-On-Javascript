Welcome to my repository of JavaScript projects! This collection showcases a variety of web development skills, ranging from basic functionality to more advanced interactive applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate specific JavaScript concepts and techniques, such as DOM manipulation, API integration, event handling, and responsive design.

These projects include practical applications like a dynamic To-Do List, an interactive Quiz App, a weather app using real-time data from APIs, and more. Whether you're looking to explore simple utilities or full-featured web applications, this repository has something to offer.

Feel free to explore the code, clone the projects, and adapt them for your own use. Each project is fully documented, making it easy for you to understand the underlying logic. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

Happy coding! 👨‍💻👩‍💻
